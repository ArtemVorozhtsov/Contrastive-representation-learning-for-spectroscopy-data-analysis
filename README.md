# Contrastive-representation-learning-for-spectroscopy-data-analysis

Spectral methods are an important tool for analyzing the structure and chemical properties of chemical compounds. However, decoding the spectra is quite a labor-intensive task, and in the case of large signal overlap, identification of separate —Åompound becomes extremely non-trivial.

In this work, a machine learning algorithm was developed to identify chemicals in mixtures based on spectral data. A set of model spectra [J. Schuetzke, N.J. Szymanski, M. Reischl, Comput. Mater. 2023, 9, 100], in which each of the 500 compounds represented by 50 spectra, differing in the degree of broadening of spectral lines, variations in the position of signals and their intensity, was used for training and testing. To achieve this goal a metric learning approach was used because it allows the algorithm to easily adapt to an increase in the number of classes. At the first stage of the algorithm high-level latent representations of spectral data are extracted from specta using a convolutional neural network. Then the class of the nearest neighbor in the latent space was assigned to the compound or mixture of the compounds. By results of the work, it was possible to develop an algorithm that effectively determines compounds by spectral data both individually and as part of mixtures.
